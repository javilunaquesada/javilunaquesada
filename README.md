# Hi, I'm Javier 👋

Mathematics & Physics graduate with 2.5+ years in technology consulting.
Currently focused on Data Analytics and Machine Learning.

I enjoy building structured, end-to-end projects where clean validation, model comparison, and generalization matter more than complexity.

## 🛠 What I Work With
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch)
- SQL (PostgreSQL)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Power BI)
- Excel
- Git & modular project architecture
- Statistical modeling and analytical problem solving

## What You’ll Find Here
Most of my repositories focus on:
- End-to-end machine learning pipelines
- Careful feature engineering
- Baseline-first modeling approach
- Model evaluation and overfitting analysis
- Clean project structure (src/, notebooks/, reproducibility)

One of my recent projects explores ATP tennis match prediction using logistic regression and neural networks, including player embeddings and representation analysis.
I care about understanding why a model works or why it fails, not just achieving a metric without meaning.

## 💡 How I Think About Machine Learning
I believe:
- Strong features often outperform complex architectures.
- Temporal validation is critical in real-world forecasting.
- Simplicity is underrated.
- Reproducibility and structure matter as much as performance.

My background in Mathematics and Physics shapes the way I approach problems: analytical, structured, and hypothesis-driven. I also like to comprehend the fundamentals behind the algorithms or techniques I implement, rather than just focusing on the results.

## Professional Background
Technology Consultant at T-Systems (BMW–NVIDIA project)
I have experience working in Agile environments, translating business requirements into technical implementations and data-driven insights.

## 🎯 Currently Interested In
- Data Analyst / Data Scientist roles
- Applied machine learning in consulting or product environments
